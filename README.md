# Random Dog generator

![dog-app-gif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce0d6c8-9550-44e4-adeb-a2531e0367b5)

A simple app that fetches and displays random images of user-selected dog breeds using the Dog API. Built as a Pre-Interview task.

## Debugging Experience

This was my first time working with Nuxt and Vue, so I spent a lot of time researching and experimenting with the framework. I found both Nuxt and Vue to be intuitive and enjoyable to use.

One challenge I faced was extracting data properly from the API response, which required thorough debugging with print statements to understand the response structure. Additionally, I encountered issues with handling `ref` values, as I initially overlooked the difference between accessing `ref` values and regular variables.
